Asyncio. It is simple and difficult at the same time. There is a beautiful code (for me ðŸ˜Š ). Itâ€™s straightforward to see where the async queue is used and its benefits.

For more details, refer to [Tornado Queues Documentation](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/queues.html).

And I have yet questions after reviewing the code:
1. **Why do the workers run for such a large portion of the code?** Can they be created only for the `fetch` method?
2. **Why is there a limit on the number of workers?** Can it be run without limits?
