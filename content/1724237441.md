I want to save data as a JSON file on the client side when a user clicks a button on web page.\
The solution I found was quite unexpected for someone not primarily focused on JavaScript. Instead of just using a separate function, an additional HTML element is required to trigger the download:
```js
  const handleSaveClick = () => {
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
    const blob = new Blob([jsonString], { type: "application/json" });

    const a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    a.download = "data.json";

    // Append the anchor to the body (it must be in the DOM for the click to work in some browsers)
    document.body.appendChild(a);
    a.click();
    document.body.removeChild(a);
  }
```

For a more robust solution, especially for handling more complex cases like large files, using an external library like [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) can be helpful. It can be included via a CDN:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/file-saver@2.0.5/dist/FileSaver.min.js"></script>
```
