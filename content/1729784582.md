I created a React project and used GitHub Pages to publish it. I used Create React App (CRA) and the [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) package to deploy the project.

As a user, I want to know if the files on the client side are up to date after deployment. To achieve this, I want a simple solution that wouldn't require adding extra modules (e.g., Webpack configuration).

One solution is to display the last build time on the client side.

Here are the steps I followed to implement this:

1. Open the `package.json` file and modify the `build` script to pass the build time as an environment variable:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "REACT_APP_BUILD_TIME=$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z') react-scripts build"
   }
   ```

   > _Note: On Windows, the command may differ slightly. Can be used:_
   ```json
   "build": "set REACT_APP_BUILD_TIME=%DATE% %TIME% && react-scripts build"
   ```

2. In the React code, I use the environment variable as follows:
   ```javascript
   const buildTime = process.env.REACT_APP_BUILD_TIME;
   return <div>Build time: {buildTime}</div>;
   ```
