**Problem**. Screen capture (in Chrome, Firefox, etc) doesn't work in my Sway environment.

I've strated from [Make screen sharing on wayland (sway) work! Â· soyuka.me](https://soyuka.me/make-screen-sharing-wayland-sway-work/) and there are a more interesting information.

**Steps to troubleshoot**:

1. **Test screen capture functionality**  
   Use the [gUM Test Page](https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html) to verify screen capture.

2. **Check if `xdg-desktop-portal` and `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` are installed**  
   I've checked different location but I've found them in `/usr/libexec/`.\
   More details:
   - [GitHub - flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal: Desktop integration portal](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal)
   - [GitHub - emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr: xdg-desktop-portal backend for wlroots](https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr)

4. **Check `dbus-update-activation-environment` setup**  
   From [XDG Desktop Portal documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal#xdg-desktop-portal-wlr_does_not_start_automatically_on_sway):

   > Check if the environment variables are set using `systemctl --user show-environment`. If not, import these variables into the systemd user session and dbus by running the following commands after launching the compositor (e.g., include them in the compositor's configuration file).

   The configuration decribed above have been found at `/etc/sway/config.d/50-systemd-user.conf`.

   And it didin't include necessary environment variables.

   Configuration to check:
   ```conf
   exec systemctl --user import-environment WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP

   exec hash dbus-update-activation-environment 2>/dev/null && \
       dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
   ```
   Other environment variables may also need to be set.
